# Resources Database Setup - Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview

Successfully implemented Phase 3 of LearnHub: Complete database schema for learning resources with RLS policies and seed data.

## What Was Built

### 1. Resources Table Schema

**Table: `public.resources`**

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `id` | uuid | PRIMARY KEY, default gen_random_uuid() | Unique identifier |
| `owner_id` | uuid | NOT NULL, FK ‚Üí profiles.id | Resource owner |
| `title` | text | NOT NULL | Resource title |
| `description` | text | NULLABLE | Short description (~500 chars) |
| `url` | text | NOT NULL, CHECK (starts with http/https) | External link |
| `type` | text | NOT NULL, CHECK ('video', 'article', 'pdf') | Resource type |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | NOT NULL, default now() | Creation timestamp |

**Indexes Created:**
- `resources_owner_id_idx` - Fast owner lookups
- `resources_type_idx` - Fast type filtering
- `resources_created_at_idx` - Sorting by newest (DESC)

**Constraints:**
- URL must start with `http://` or `https://`
- Type must be one of: `video`, `article`, or `pdf`
- Foreign key cascade delete (if profile deleted, resources deleted)

### 2. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

‚úÖ **RLS Enabled** on resources table

**Three Policies Created:**

1. **"Resources are viewable by everyone"**
   - Operation: SELECT
   - Access: Public (anonymous + authenticated)
   - Rule: `true`
   - Purpose: Anyone can browse resources

2. **"Authenticated users can insert resources"**
   - Operation: INSERT
   - Access: Authenticated users only
   - Rule: `(select auth.uid()) = owner_id`
   - Purpose: Logged-in users can create resources (only as themselves)

3. **"Users can delete their own resources"**
   - Operation: DELETE
   - Access: Authenticated users only
   - Rule: `(select auth.uid()) = owner_id`
   - Purpose: Owners can delete their own resources only

**Performance Optimization:**
- All policies use `(select auth.uid())` instead of `auth.uid()` for better query performance at scale
- Prevents unnecessary re-evaluation for each row

### 3. Seed Data

Inserted **5 example resources** covering all types:

1. **React 19 Complete Tutorial** (video)
   - Comprehensive React 19 features tutorial
   - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example1

2. **TypeScript Best Practices 2025** (article)
   - Modern TypeScript patterns and advanced types
   - https://dev.to/example/typescript-best-practices

3. **Next.js App Router Guide** (pdf)
   - Official Next.js App Router documentation
   - https://nextjs.org/docs/app-router-guide.pdf

4. **Database Design Fundamentals** (video)
   - Complete database design principles course
   - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example2

5. **Web Accessibility Made Simple** (article)
   - WCAG 2.2 standards and inclusive web guide
   - https://www.smashingmagazine.com/accessibility-guide

All resources owned by: `markes_do` (existing test user)

## Verification Results

### Table Status
- ‚úÖ Table created successfully
- ‚úÖ RLS enabled
- ‚úÖ 5 rows inserted
- ‚úÖ All constraints working
- ‚úÖ Indexes created

### Security Check
- ‚úÖ No critical security issues
- ‚úÖ RLS policies active and optimized
- ‚ö†Ô∏è General auth warnings (not schema-related):
  - Leaked password protection disabled (project setting)
  - Insufficient MFA options (project setting)

### Performance Check
- ‚úÖ RLS policies optimized with `(select auth.uid())`
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Unused index warnings (expected for new table)
  - Indexes will be used once app queries start

## Database Migrations Applied

1. **`create_resources_table`** - Table schema with constraints and indexes
2. **`enable_resources_rls`** - RLS policies (SELECT, INSERT, DELETE)
3. **Performance optimization** - Updated policies for better performance

## How to Verify in Supabase Dashboard

### View Resources Table
1. Go to **Table Editor**
2. Select **`resources`** table
3. Should see 5 rows with diverse content

### Check RLS Policies
1. Go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Policies**
2. Select **`resources`** table
3. Should see 3 active policies:
   - Resources are viewable by everyone (SELECT)
   - Authenticated users can insert resources (INSERT)
   - Users can delete their own resources (DELETE)

### Test RLS Security

**As Anonymous User:**
```sql
-- Should work (public read)
SELECT * FROM resources;

-- Should fail (auth required)
INSERT INTO resources (owner_id, title, url, type) 
VALUES ('...', 'Test', 'https://example.com', 'article');
```

**As Authenticated User:**
```sql
-- Should work (insert as self)
INSERT INTO resources (owner_id, title, url, type) 
VALUES (auth.uid(), 'My Resource', 'https://example.com', 'video');

-- Should work (delete own resource)
DELETE FROM resources WHERE id = '...' AND owner_id = auth.uid();

-- Should fail (delete others' resource)
DELETE FROM resources WHERE owner_id != auth.uid();
```

## Next Steps: Phase 4 - CRUD Operations

Now that the database is ready, you can proceed with:

### Phase 4: Create Resource Form
- Build `/submit` form with validation
- Use Shadcn UI form components
- Implement server action to insert resources
- Add success/error handling
- Redirect to resource detail page

### Phase 5: Read Resources
- Build `/resources` list page with cards
- Implement search functionality (title + description)
- Add type filter dropdown
- Implement pagination (20 items per page)
- Build `/resource/[id]` detail page

### Phase 6: Delete Resources
- Add delete button on resource cards (owner only)
- Implement confirmation dialog
- Add delete server action
- Update UI after deletion

## Technical Notes

### Type System
The `type` field uses text with CHECK constraint instead of ENUM for flexibility:
- Easy to extend in future (add: course, book, podcast, tool)
- No schema migration needed to add types
- Still enforces validation at database level

### URL Validation
- Database validates `http://` or `https://` prefix
- Application should validate URL format before submission
- No reachability check in MVP (deferred to Phase A)

### Cascade Delete
- If a profile is deleted, all their resources are automatically deleted
- Maintains referential integrity
- No orphaned resources

### Performance Considerations
- Indexes on owner_id, type, and created_at for fast queries
- RLS policies optimized with `(select auth.uid())`
- Ready for production scale

## Success! üéâ

Phase 3 complete:
- ‚úÖ Resources table with proper schema
- ‚úÖ Optimized RLS policies
- ‚úÖ 5 diverse seed resources
- ‚úÖ No security vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ Ready for CRUD implementation

The database foundation is solid and secure. You can now build the resource submission form and listing pages!
